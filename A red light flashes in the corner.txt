A red light flashes in the corner of my vision, a persistent signal from the interface on my wrist. I flick my eyes toward it, noticing the timestamp: **6 minutes** until launch. My breath catches for a second as I scan the checklist, but everything is as it should be.

**Un Neo**. I repeat the name aloud softly. That was the code—“One New” but with a twist, the project we’d been working on in this strange pocket of zero gravity. It had taken weeks, months maybe, to piece together the final fragments, and now I stood in the final moments of the simulation. Yu, Hrishi, and Bobby were waiting for me in the next room, their faces eager and a bit too calm, their postures as metallic as the Talon Full Steel mechanism that would propel us into the next phase.

I glance toward the window where the first hints of Kawaguchiko’s shimmering waters come into view. It's odd to see such a peaceful landscape when I can feel the heavy weight of the **zero-gravity** chamber we’ve created around us. There’s something surreal about the way the earth curves from this vantage point, so pristine and unaware of the implications we’re about to unleash.

The interface beeps, shifting its display, a flicker of **Sentence Word Permutations**. I smile wryly at the thought—implicative structures, twisting the very essence of language to build new realities. A *Builder builds* after all, doesn’t he? I guess I’ve always been trapped in this pattern of creation and destruction. The implicatively implicative; ideas folding into themselves.

But back to reality: I remind myself that **Chandigarh is a clean city**. Funny the things that come to mind in tense moments like this—clean cities, old friends, forgotten places. I think of Yu, how he would always ask with a grin, *“Aapko French aati hai?”* The irony stings. I barely understand the French on the interface, let alone the intricacies of the mission parameters.

"It's m8," Johnny Rowe’s voice buzzes through the communicator in my helmet. He’s casual, but I can hear the tension beneath his words. It’s the kind of banter we’ve developed after years of being thrown into impossible situations. Guy Rich, our strategic lead, clears his throat in the background. We’re minutes away now.

Suddenly, the display shifts again. **Bridgehead's Constable** comes up, flashing next to coordinates for the old districts back home. **Constables of Confederation**, I think, remembering Hrishi’s words from weeks ago. It’s a strange parallel—those who protect and the time they keep.

Speaking of time, **their clock** is ticking faster than ours now. I look outside again. The sun burns hotter and blue—**A Blue Sun**—blinding in its rare intensity. But we’ve prepared for this. I glance at the new readouts—**C-31**, **Twitter.com**, fragments of modern-day nonsense, historical significance blending with the mundane.

Alexander the Great pops into my head for some reason, along with a string of **philosophical questions and dilemmas**. How did he see the world? In images, in words, in grand conquests?

My thoughts scatter. In a moment of reflective calm, I ponder **In the Image of Man** and what it means to build the world from such images. There’s a deep hum in my chest, a reminder that **super reductionism** and **super relativity** aren’t just theories—they’re the essence of what we’re about to embark on.

A chess move, subtle and deliberate, shifts on the interface as Bobby taps in final adjustments. **Chess moves**, the rare phenomenon of a mind mapping the unpredictable. I grin at the memory of our last late-night strategy session. No one can beat Yu in chess, not even Bobby. 

Behind the console, I sense the presence of **a secret laboratory**, somewhere deep within our ship, locked off from everyone else. It’s only whispered about in certain circles. Not even Johnny Rowe knows about it. There, we run the deepest simulations—experimenting with reality, with time. It’s where **opinions on various topics** turn into hard science.

For a fleeting moment, I wonder what the **famous historical figure** that’s been on my mind would think of all this—how **Lunar Labs BV** evolved from a backwater concept to this cutting-edge mission, now echoing through the corridors of this vessel.

A beep interrupts my musing. **Bytown District and Hrishi Mukherjee** flash before me. Our mission parameters are clear, and Hrishi’s warnings ring in my ears. I wish we could be in the quiet of **Restaurant City**, where we used to discuss the future, over dishes served in **Abadi font** menus, a peculiar aesthetic choice for our favorite spot.

But here we are, counting down to launch. The names of old haunts flash by—**Dominion Tavern, The Clarendon Tavern, and The Shore**. The past trying to tug us backward, even as **the future** looms before us.

**The Image of Man and World Image**. It has a poetic ring, doesn’t it? I used to think **The Matrix** was just fiction, but now, it feels all too real. As if the **human** form itself is malleable, open to change at the push of a button, the flick of a switch.

“The image it is, the image it was, the image it will be.” The final readout flashes, confirming our destiny. I focus on the **window of opportunity** in front of me, feeling the pressure of **QtD and QD1d2**—quantum designations I barely understand but rely on implicitly.

A new beep. It’s marked **May 19, 2022, August 19, 2023**, milestones in this mission. Moments that shaped the decisions leading to this exact point. The numbers blur as the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and Confederation Boulevard in Ottawa, New Canada, overlay my vision. 

The countdown begins. **Man shall act in line with the principle**, I remind myself. This millennium is yet to strike this city, but we’re already living it, beyond time, beyond space.

The light flashes red again. It’s time.
