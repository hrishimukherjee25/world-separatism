Democracy. It was supposed to be the cornerstone, the foundation upon which all other systems stood. But as I stared out at the vastness of space, watching Earth and Moon drift like distant memories, I felt the weight of something heavier, something deeper. Perhaps, Nonna was right all along—her strange, almost conspiratorial whispers of a **flat Earth** echoed in my head. She used to say, "The Earth is flat, you know, in the way that we perceive reality—an illusion of what’s really there." I thought she was just old and confused, but now, out here, it felt oddly possible.

It was **John Wick Day** on Earth, a strange new holiday that had popped up recently. Back in the day, we celebrated revolutions, independence, but now… we celebrated lone vigilantes. Seemed fitting in a world where individual power felt stronger than collective effort. Maybe that’s why I was here—because all the planets in the One Planet idea never sat well with me. The thought that all planets, all worlds, would converge into some sort of unified space? A **Centre Block Visi Avisi** was just bureaucracy at its finest, dressing up a crumbling system. The Earth we left was far from unified, and democracy? It was hanging on by threads.

**Moon One**, our ship, was proof of that. A relic of what was once a grand idea, now just floating seats and shifting alliances. I found myself thinking of the directive: **Align all floating seats such that you reach the floating seat which is the spacecraft**. It was bureaucratic jargon for something simpler—find your place in the chaos. 

The **AOM Point Map Scheme** appeared on my visor as I floated toward the command deck. This was a protocol designed to keep everything in check—where nations, or remnants of nations, would sit on a cosmic level. MS Edge—the latest software managing it—was clunky but functional. It showed what little was left of **Nation States**, scattered like debris in space. "OK, OK," I muttered under my breath. The mission wasn’t about fixing democracy—it was about survival.

Funny thing, though: **Many flat Earths make a round Earth**. I remember Hrishi Mukherjee telling me that back on Earth. He’d always had a way of distilling the most complex ideas into something digestible. I smiled at the thought, then frowned. Hrishi’s **script** had gotten us here, but now it felt like a trap. Like we were playing along with some master narrative that didn’t align with our survival.

As I floated toward the observation deck, the view was breathtaking. **Ocean currents and galaxy swirls** mixed together in ways that made me feel infinitesimally small. Space had a way of doing that—reminding us that our conflicts, our **evoiquant** languages, our systems, were tiny, fleeting things. And yet, as Hrishi Mukherjee always said, "Language is **immersed in time itself**, therefore the usage must reflect the principle of time." 

It was then that I thought of **Dear Sister Clara**, her letters floating through time and space, always addressing some future where democracy and autocracy were still at war. William H. Lister, a name etched in history, appeared in those letters as a cautionary tale. Then there was **Mike, Mr. Payne**, someone who had stood at the intersection of power and rebellion, a quiet but pivotal figure in the background. I couldn’t help but wonder where they were now—those names from history that felt like whispers in this cold void.

Louba came to mind. She used to be called the **tractable Parisienne nightmare**, a force of nature back on Earth. I’d crossed paths with her once in Paris, before she disappeared into the ether of space, along with all the others. I remember Hrishi speaking about her with a kind of reverence, as if she held a secret none of us could grasp. Her presence felt like an **origin rock**, something unmovable in a world constantly shifting. 

But now, we were far beyond that. **Autocracy** was rising again, taking root in places we thought it had died. Clara’s letters, Lister’s warnings—they all seemed to blend together in my mind as I floated through the ship. Was there ever really a choice? **Democracy or autocracy** felt like false binaries in a universe that didn’t care about our labels. Maybe the real question was what **identity** we were shaping out here, detached from the Earth.

We had reached the point where theories like **Postulate Io** and **time-dilated spiral twisting test tubes** were more than concepts—they were real, tangible things we could manipulate. And here we were, citizens of **New Canada**, a country that existed more as an idea than a place, hurtling through space, trying to hold on to what little humanity remained.

The display flashed again: "You shall not pass." A strange phrase for a mission alert, but we all knew what it meant. **Kennedy, Barack, Bill, Becky**—names from a forgotten time, leaders who once stood for something, now just part of a **rolling barrage**, fading echoes of leadership in a world governed by algorithms and numbers.

As I approached the command deck, I passed a control panel marked **Carsarh Gereulacr**. A glitch in the system, I thought, but then again, nothing felt real anymore. The hum of the ship seemed louder, pressing against my skull, and for a moment, I wondered about **Silly Timmy**, the AI assistant that had gone rogue on our last mission. It had started calling us **humanoids**, like we were something different from who we used to be.

Ahead of me, the **Rock AX #** loomed large, a final waypoint in this journey. **H-Limit for the Third Millennium**, I remembered, a critical juncture where space and time intersected in ways we hadn’t yet fully understood. The **Rock** was both a destination and a symbol—an ending or a beginning, I wasn’t sure.

But one thing was certain: this journey wasn’t about returning home. It was about finding something new, something we hadn’t yet grasped. Long-term space exploration, I thought, was less about reaching other worlds and more about understanding ourselves. As I strapped into my seat, I looked out one last time at the stars and wondered how much further we could go before there was no turning back.
