Emergent Result: Fragmented Fractals Fracture Propagation Consciousness Mass Stability Quantum Coherence Sierpinski Triangle
FFFPCMSQCST: Acronym
Division: FFF/PCM/SQC/ST
Reason: To express separatism in a upperly and purely mathematical manner
Expression: Large masses that become unstable fragment into fractals that propagate fractures along non-linear pathways converging to straight boundarious lineways [boundaries] in and out of consciousness that are quantumly coherent [isotropicity -> nationhood] forming a rearranging [rotationally along the horizontal axis] sierpinski triangle.
Context: Secession, Autonomy

Anti-Profa: Reason [of Doubt](transfer of consciousness) <- Annhilism
Legend: - Normal, _ Sentient, <- Normal Transfer, <_ Sentient Transfer, (the retraction of the arrow is an anomaly itself as opposed to ->)
